### Overview

- A dialog-based Illustrator tool to sort selected objects by "Height", "Width", "Opacity", "Color", or group text numbers, and align/distribute them horizontally or vertically.
- Fully customizable with real-time preview for direction, criteria, order, spacing, and width/height unification.

### Main Features

- Sort by height, width, opacity, color, or numbers (text inside groups)
- Auto-detect or choose horizontal/vertical direction
- Adjust spacing (even, tight, custom)
- Unify width or height (max/min)
- Simple alignment options (left/center/right, top/middle/bottom)
- Japanese and English UI support

### Process Flow

1. Configure criteria, direction, and options via dialog
2. Sort selected objects based on chosen criteria
3. Preview alignment and spacing in real time
4. Apply or cancel to revert to original positions
